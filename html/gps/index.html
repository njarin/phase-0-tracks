	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>HTML5 semantic tags make it easier to navigate webpages, especially for people who are differently abled. I see main and section as particularly useful semantic tags right now.</p>
	<p>The browser will prioritize elements within the main tag, with headers appearing first, then sections within the same main tag, and finally, asides and footers.</p>
	<p>I learned how to make a snippet! I can't wait to do more challenges and figure out which snippets I can create to help me make redundant tasks a breeze. A snippet laying out a blog post webpage would be a good one to create.</p>
	<p>Figuring out how to read a snippet and where to put which information was probably the most difficult. I can better at this by looking at more examples of snippets and experimenting with making more of my own, which I plan to do.</p>

PAIRING 8.4 


2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

COMMAND:
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT:
1|5|it was a great wedding!|1|4|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Steven|Wonder
2|3|it smelled like feet|2|1|2|Lotus Yoga|1|Bradford|Pit
3|1|I got food poisoning...sad|3|2|3|Sushi World|2|Mandy|Kaling
4|4|she did great work|4|3|4|Plumbing by Janet|3|Angela|Jolie

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

COMMAND:
sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.First_Name, users.Last_Name FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT:
5|it was a great wedding!|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Steven|Wonder
3|it smelled like feet|Lotus Yoga|Bradford|Pit
1|I got food poisoning...sad|Sushi World|Mandy|Kaling
4|she did great work|Plumbing by Janet|Angela|Jolie

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

COMMAND: 
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name = "Sushi World";

OUTPUT:
3|1|I got food poisoning...sad|3|2|3|Sushi World|2|Mandy|Kaling

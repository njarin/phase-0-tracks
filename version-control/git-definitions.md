# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is way to create a system of backups via save points along a timeline from creation through the current moment. By using version control, it is easier to rollback a program if there was a mistake. It's also easier to work on the program -- even have several people working on it -- without altering the master version until you absolutely mean to. Version control offers many benefits, including making it easier to track down bugs and update a program without having the changes go 'live' until a launch date. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a feature of a git repository. A branch is used in order to create an alternate timeline for a program. It allow a developer to alter a project without the changes risking damage to the original and without the changes going into action before they are ready. The branch can later be merged with the master branch. That would combine the work done in that branch with the original project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in the timeline of the version control. A commit saves the changes since the last version and includes a message about what those changes are. This makes it easier to track down possible bugs later on or pinpoint a version that would be a good one to roll back to. A good commit message is clearly descriptive and succinct. It communicates what changes were done to the project. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when some code is trying to occupy the same space or is directing the project toward two or more things that can not be done at the same time.

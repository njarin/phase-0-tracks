# Create a class for the word game

# Word Game: 
# User 1 inputs a secret word
# User 2 guesses words until they match all letters in the secret word
# 	Rules: 
# 		Player gets the same number of guesses as there are letters in the word
# 		If player guesses a word with some matching letters, they get to know which ones matched
# 		A repeated guess doesn't count against number of guesses left
# 		Player wins if they match all letters
# 		Player loses if they spend all guesses and their guess word isn't the secret word 

# Need to create a class with attributes for the secret word, the guess letter, the guessed letters, clue word, turns left
# 	Take secret word on initialization
# 	Display secret word with letters blanked out
# 	Need methods for guessing letters
# 		Has this letter been guessed before? 
# 		Store guess letter for checking later for doubled up guess
# 		Fill in any matching letters between secret word and guess letter
# 		Display partially filled-in or still blanked out word 
# 	Endgame:
# 		If counter hits 0, player loses
# 		If clue word == secret word, player wins


# Method for giving a secret word to guess
# input: string
# steps: 
# 	Store the secret word provided during initialization
# output: string

# Method checking if guessed letter has been guessed before
# input: string (guess letter), array (guessed letters)
# steps: 
# 	Check if guess letter is included guessed letters
# 	Return false if letter is not present yet
# 	Return true if letter has already been guessed
# output: boolean

# Method for adding new guess to previously guessed letters
# input: string, array
# steps: 
# 	Add input string as new value in array
# output: array

# Method tracking progress word
# input: string (secret word), array (guessed letter)
# steps: 
# 	Split secret word into array
# 	Keep letter if present in guessed letter array
# 	If letter doesnâ€™t match any, turn it into an asterisk
# 	Combine letters back into a string
# output: string (progress word)

# Method for tracking number of turns left
# input: string (secret word), array (guessed letters)
# steps: 
# 	Determine length of secret word
# 	Determine number of guessed letters
# 	Subtract length of secret word from number of guessed letters
# output: integer (number of turns left)

# Method for triggering loss message
# input: integer (number of turns)
# steps: 
# 	If number of turns left = 0, display taunting losing message
# output: string (display message)

# Method for triggering win message
# input: string (secret word), string (progress word)
# steps: 
# 	Does secret word == progress word? 
# 	Display winning message if true
# output: string (congratulatory message)

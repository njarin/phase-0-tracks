# Robot to Elevator pseudocode 

- For a trip downstairs from my penthouse apartment: 
	- To walk: Use motor functions in lower extremities to propel yourself laterally at a decibel level no higher than 0db, a height off the ground no higher than 20cm, and a lateral speed no faster than 3mph
		- Lift foot, move forward, set foot down
		- Repeat with other foot
		- Use alternating pattern to propel yourself forward
	- Until you have left the apartment, look for front door
		- Scan room you are in
		- If no front door is present, then leave room
			- To leave room, walk through doorway to next room
			- Scan room for front door
		- Else, open front door 
	- Walk through front door
	- Close front door behind you
	- Until you are close enough to touch elevator call button, walk along hallway
		- Lift upper extremity
		- Fold outer most extremity into a form where only one digit is extended
		- Press single digit into elevator button on panel with no more than a half-pound PSI for no longer than .5 seconds
		- Walk a couple steps away from call button
		- Orient towards elevator door
		- Cease motor function until elevator doors to open
	- When elevator doors open, walk through them into elevator
	- Visually find button panel
		- Scan for button with “1” on it
	- Press 1 in same way that elevator call button was pressed, ignore any other buttons on panel
	- Move to portion of elevator floor furthest from other passengers, if they are present
	- Cease motor functions until elevator doors open again
	- When elevator doors open… 
		- If there are other passengers, wait for them to leave first
		- Walk through door

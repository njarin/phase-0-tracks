#jQuery research notes

* Find a primer
* Find a cheat sheet with most-used functions to get an idea of how most people use it
* Find a tutorial so I can experiment with it
* Find some code to look over and maybe experiment with too
* Build something of my own using jQuery


## Revisiting strategy

* I ended up finding that I learned the most once I started trying it myself. I did a tutorial, but it didn't help much, so I started looked up code snippets and experimenting with what I could do using jQuery instead. That forced me to learn some things that I wasn't getting from the tutorials or the cheat sheets, such as how to link a page to jQuery in the first place.
